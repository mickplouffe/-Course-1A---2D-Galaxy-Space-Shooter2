Hi! 
There is some change I made. Since lot in the course is challenge. I made some things as mine.

1- I haven't applied the code to make the warp/tp effect when the "player ship" pass the X borders. I do not feel like it adds anything to the gameplay.
1.1- I code it, but put it in comment to disable it.

2- I haven't applied the code to make the warp/tp effect when the "ennemy ship" pass the Y border at the bottom. I do not feel like it adds anything to the gameplay. 

3- The Speed Upgrade: I change it to change the Fire Rate instead of ship movement speed.

4- The meteorite as been added as the course says, but I would have change it for a screen to pess "fire" to start. Then the metorite spawn more frequantly than enemy ships.


IF there is any change or way to aproach a problem that should be change. Even if is pass the test. Please feel free the comment so I can learn from it.
