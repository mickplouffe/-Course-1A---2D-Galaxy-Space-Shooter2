Hi! 
There is some change I made. Since a lot in the course is meant to be a challenge. I made some things as mine.

NOTE: I just saw that the damage visualisation on the Player Ship is not implemanted. I will Push it again later.

1- I haven't applied the code to make the warp/tp effect when the "player ship" pass the X borders. I do not feel like it adds anything meaningful to the gameplay.
1.1- I coded it, but put it in comments to disable it.

2- I haven't applied the code to make the warp/tp effect when the "ennemy ship" pass the Y border at the bottom. I do not feel like it adds anything to the gameplay. 

3- The Speed Upgrade: I change it to change the Fire Rate instead of ship movement speed.

4- The meteorite as been added as the course says, but I would have change it for a screen to pess "fire" to start. Then the metorite spawn more frequantly than enemy ships.


If there is any change or way to aproach a problem that should be concidered. Even if is pass the test. Please feel free the comment so I can learn from it.
